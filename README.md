Task 1: Use a "for" loop to iterate over an array
●	Create an array of numbers.
●	Use a "for" loop to iterate over the array and log each number to the console.
Task 2: Use a "for" loop to iterate in reverse
●	Create an array of strings.
●	Use a "for" loop to iterate over the array in reverse and log each string to the console.
Task 3: Use a "for...in" loop to iterate over an object
●	Create an object with key-value pairs representing personal information (name, age, city, etc.).
●	Use a "for...in" loop to iterate over the object and log each key-value pair to the console.
Task 4: Use a "while" loop with a condition
●	Declare a variable with an initial value.
●	Use a "while" loop with a condition to increment the variable until it reaches a specified value.
●	Log the value of the variable at each iteration.
Task 5: Use a "do...while" loop
●	Declare a variable with an initial value.
●	Use a "do...while" loop to increment the variable until it reaches a specified value.
●	Log the value of the variable at each iteration.
Task 6: Use the "break" statement
●	Create a loop that counts from 1 to 10.
●	Use an "if" statement to check if the current iteration is 5.
●	If the condition is true, use the "break" statement to exit the loop.
Task 7: Use the "continue" statement
●	Create a loop that counts from 1 to 10.
●	Use an "if" statement to check if the current iteration is divisible by 2.
●	If the condition is true, use the "continue" statement to skip the current iteration and move to the next.
Task 8: Use nested loops
●	Create a nested loop structure to generate a multiplication table.
●	Use two "for" loops to iterate over values from 1 to 10 and calculate the product of each combination.
Task 9: Use array methods for iteration
●	Create an array of names.
●	Use array methods like forEach(), map(), or filter() to perform specific actions on the array elements.
Task 10: Use "for...of" loop for iterable objects
●	Create an iterable object, such as an array or string.
●	Use a "for...of" loop to iterate over the elements of the object and perform actions based on each element.
